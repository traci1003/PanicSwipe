Panic Swipe is a powerful and discreet safety tool, especially for activists, organizers, and anyone in sensitive communities like PSL or those advocating for Palestine or other social justice causes.

Here’s the full layout and design plan for the app:
🛡️ App Name: Panic Swipe

Disguised emergency exit / app cloaker
🧠 Core Purpose:

When you perform a secret swipe pattern or gesture, the app instantly:

    Hides/disguises sensitive apps

    Logs you out of specific platforms (Twitter, email, Signal, etc.)

    Clears tabs, chat logs, or opens a decoy screen

📲 Main Features
🔐 1. Secret Panic Gesture

    Default: Triple swipe up + hold (or customizable)

    Triggers instantly — even if the screen is locked

🎭 2. App Disguiser

    Lets you select "protected apps" (e.g., Signal, ProtonMail, Telegram)

    When triggered:

        Icons disappear

        App name + icon can be replaced with decoys (e.g., a “Calculator”)

        Apps are locked behind a PIN, fake crash screen, or “Not Installed” prompt

🧼 3. Auto-Wipe Options

    Wipe browser tabs, clipboard, and recent messages

    Optional “burn mode” to clear recent chats from selected apps

    Option to log out of social media accounts (via API if possible)

🧪 4. Decoy Mode

    You set up a decoy homepage that looks harmless (e.g., shopping list or clock)

    Panic swipe switches to decoy instantly — to stall questioning or searches

📦 5. Vault Mode (Optional)

    Secure file/image vault that gets hidden during panic

    Only visible through a long-press on an invisible icon or via biometric

🛠️ 6. Setup Wizard

    Onboarding walkthrough:

🎨 UI/UX Style

    Dark theme with high contrast buttons

    Minimalist & fast (low animation so it works instantly)

    No obvious branding — makes it look like a utility or system tool

💸 Monetization (Optional):

    Free version: 3 protected apps + gesture lock

    Pro: Unlimited apps, file vault, advanced cloaking ($2.99 one-time or $0.99/mo)
